Brain tumor segmentation using 3D U-Net on the BraTS 2023 dataset. It includes steps for loading multi-modal MRI scans (T1n, T1c, T2w, T2f), normalizing data, extracting patches, and training a basic 3D segmentation model. For demonstration purposes, training was done on a small subset due to limited computational resource.
